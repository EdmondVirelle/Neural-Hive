# Contributing to Neural Hive

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Neural Hive! It's people like you that make such open source projects awesome.

We welcome any type of contribution, not only code. You can help with:
*   **Reporting a bug**
*   **Discussing the current state of the code**
*   **Submitting a fix**
*   **Proposing new features**
*   **Improving documentation**

## We Use GitHub Flow

We use GitHub Flow, so all code changes happen through Pull Requests.
1.  Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2.  If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3.  Ensure the test suite passes (`npm test`).
4.  Make sure your code lints (`npm run lint`).
5.  Issue that pull request!

## Reporting Bugs

Before creating a bug report, please check our issues board as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

## Proposing a Change (Pull Request)

1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch.
2.  Set up your development environment:
    ```bash
    # Install dependencies
    npm install
    
    # Run the app in development mode
    npm run dev
    npm run dev:electron # In a separate terminal
    ```
3.  Make your changes in your branch.
4.  Please ensure you have followed the code style for the project. Run `npm run lint` to check.
5.  Commit your changes, and push your branch to your fork.
6.  Open a Pull Request to the `main` branch of the original repository.
7.  In the PR description, please provide a clear explanation of the problem you are solving and the changes you have made.

## Code Style

We use Prettier and ESLint to maintain a consistent code style. Please run `npm run lint` before committing your changes to automatically fix any stylistic issues.

## Any questions?

If you have any questions, feel free to open an issue and we'll be happy to help.

Thank you for your contribution!
